# Lab 5: Data Scavenger Hunt

Due: 14 October 2025

## Instructions

Write a python program (`lab5.py`) that creates a report answering the
questions posed in this lab assignment using the data found in your
`"counties.csv"`. The report should be a text file named
\`\`report.md\'\' formatted in Markdown (see
<https://www.markdownguide.org/> for the syntax for Markdown). Do
**not** commit the report, just the program and dataset used to generate
the report. You are expected to document your code and create tests for
any functions you create or complete to complete this assignment in an
appropriately named file.

## Find the county where...

For the following questions, find the county or counties that fit the
description. Your report for this should have a top-level header
containing the lab title, followed by a subsection for each county
description in this exercise. The body of each subsection should contain
a generated sentence of the form: \"{county}, {state} is the
{description} in the United States.\" followed by a table showing the
relevant data points for that and up to four others (five total). You
may ignore ties for this exercise.

1.  Most temperature stable (i.e. least variation between Jan, Apr, Jul,
    and Oct temperatures)
2.  Least temperature stable
3.  Fastest growing
4.  Fastest declining
5.  Deadliest (total deaths by homicide, suicide, and vehicle per
    capita)
6.  Least deadly
7.  Most skewed female
8.  Most skewed male
9.  Oldest (highest percentage of the population over 65)
10. Youngest (highest percentage of the population under 20)
11. Most age diverse (lowest variance between age catagories)
12. Highest employment
13. Highest unemployment
